# VIEW THE WEBSITE



## Getting started

If you haven't already, you'll need to install Git on your computer. You can download it from the official Git website: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.


To be able to see the content of this code, you'll need a code editor for the HTML and CSS files. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text,
or Atom. You can download and install one of these or use your preferred code editor. (I personally use VScode for the extensions that let you preview the website on a live
server).

## Clone the GitHub Repository

1. Go to the GitHub repository that you want to clone in your web browser.

2. Click on the "Code" button on the repository's main page. It will give you the URL of the repository. Make sure it's set to "HTTPS" if you're not using SSH keys.

3. Copy the URL to your clipboard.

4. Open your terminal or command prompt.

5. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the repository using the `cd` command. For example, to create a folder called "my-project" and navigate into it, you can use:

```bash
   mkdir my-project
   cd my-project
```
6. In the terminal, use the git clone command to clone the repository. Replace <repository URL> with the URL you copied in step 3:

```bash
  git clone <repository URL>
```

## View HTML and CSS Content

1. Open your code editor.

2. Use the code editor to navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository (the "my-project" folder, in the example above).

3. Inside the cloned repository folder, you'll find the HTML and CSS files. You can typically find HTML files with `.html` extensions and CSS files with `.css` extensions.

4. Open the HTML and CSS files in your code editor to view the content. (If you're using VScode, I recommend adding the extension `Live Server` by Ritwick Dey).
